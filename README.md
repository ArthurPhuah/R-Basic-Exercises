# R-Exercises

Source: https://www.w3resource.com/r-programming-exercises/

I found these exercises useful during my learning of the R-language. The only downside to these exercises is that they do not explain what's going on with their code in their solutions but gives you the simple solution. I have added some additional conditions to some of these exercises to push myself further so the solutions would not always look exactly the same as in the link above. 

Hopefully this finished exercises' code with comments could help anyone who needs that extra kick out there.
