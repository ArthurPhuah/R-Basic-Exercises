# R-Exercises

Source: https://www.w3resource.com/r-programming-exercises/

I found these exercises useful for those that are new to R. The only downside to these exercises is that they do not explain what's going on in their solutions and expect you to understand. Hopefully this finished exercises' code with comments could help anyone who needs that extra kick out there.
